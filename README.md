This was just an exercise for  login authentication, API, generic routing, an a wee bit of css, and pure JavaScript.
Using local storage for login, firebase API. 
I didn't really know what I was doing, as I was just 3 months in to Javascript.
Just change the address in the router to see the app.
baseUrl: "http://127.0.0.1:xxxx/index.html",
